<p>Human facial expressions contain substantial information about how a person is feeling at any instant. People can fake their facial expressions but micro-expressions, which are short, involuntary facial expressions, can reveal a person’s underlying emotions even when the person is trying to conceal their feelings. In this project, we build a system for automatic facial expression recognition (FER) and later extend this system for micro-expression recognition (MER). For FER, we evaluate and compare performance of two different feature descriptors, Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ). For MER, we examine the performance of LBP on Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) and evaluate the performance of the LPQ-TOP feature descriptor which has not been applied to this problem in the past. Our results show that LPQ and its variants perform slightly better than LBP for both facial expression recognition and micro-expression recognition in our experiments on the Cohn Kanade and CASME II datasets.</p>

<p>For our facial expression recognition system, we used the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database, , one of the most popular and comprehensive facial-expression image databases. All image sequences show subject’s faces in full frontal view with little horizontal or vertical rotation.</p>

<p>We chose the CASME II database for our Micro-Expression Recognition experiments. All sequences in the dataset were captured with 200 fps camera and all samples have a large face size of about 280 pixels by 340 pixels. In addition, the researchers elicited spontaneous micro-expressions from participants by asking them to suppress their facial expressions while viewing emotional videos. The researchers simulated a high-stakes situation by forcing participants to take a long and boring survey if they were caught displaying a facial expression. The ground truth in the database was established by two facial action coders who independently labeled each image sequence into one of five labels: happiness, disgust, surprise, repression, and others.</p>
